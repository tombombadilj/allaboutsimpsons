# allaboutsimpsons
The analysis takes a look at the Simpsons data provided on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data). Data were downloaded and placed in to a sql database. The EDA jupyter notebook included data cleaning and simple visualization using sql, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The same EDA jupyter notebook can also be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jasonchiu0803/all-about-the-simpson).
